								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>The One Minute Manager</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; This book by Kenneth Blanchard  is unlike any other book of its genre. It is written in a story format. Opening pages arouse such kind of curiosity that it make you jump straight into it. In this 100-page story, a man is in search of an effective manager. Throughout his journey he learns many lessons.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A young man searches all over the world for an example of a great manager. He wants to work for one and learn how to become one. But most of the workplaces he has seen do not provide any great inspiration. He meets hard-nosed managers who get things done but who the staff do not much like, and nice managers who love their staff but do not pay enough attention to the bottom line.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet a true leader will find it difficult to get anywhere without some basic people management skills. He or she will seek to create relaxed workplaces in which people have all the time they need to pursue important goals.
